# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains all my practice projects, experiments, and projects while learning **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** from scratch.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- PyTorch (coming soon)
- Streamlit / Flask for deployment (coming soon)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 🚀 Projects Highlight

### Hand Drawing Recognition Web App (Digit & Drawing Recognizer (Live Demo)
A web app that recognizes hand-drawn digits and doodles in real-time using a CNN trained on Google's Quick, Draw! dataset.

Live app → `app/main.py` (run with `streamlit run app/main.py`)

## 🎯 What's Inside
- From-scratch implementations of core algorithms
- Kaggle competitions solutions (Titanic, Employee performance, etc.)
- End-to-end deep learning projects with deployment
- Lots of Jupyter notebooks explaining concepts step-by-step

## 💡 Purpose of This Repo
This is my personal learning playground. Code might not always be perfect — but it's honest, well-commented, and improving every day.

Feel free to fork, star ⭐, or use any code for your own learning!
